# Code Explanation - Data Analysis and Linear Regression

This README provides an overview of the Python script that demonstrates data analysis and linear regression techniques using the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn libraries. The script involves data preprocessing, visualization, simple and multiple linear regression, as well as the evaluation of model performance.

## Concepts Covered

### Importing Libraries

- Importing essential libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and collections.

### Data Preprocessing

- Loading datasets ('insurance.csv' and 'Admission_Predict_Ver1.1_small_data_set_for_Linear_Regression.csv') using Pandas.
- Dropping unnecessary columns using the `drop` function.
- Normalizing numeric columns using the `normalize_numeric_minmax` function.

### Simple Linear Regression

- Implementing simple linear regression using Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Predicting values using the linear regression model.
- Visualizing and evaluating model performance with scatter plots, root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).

### Multiple Linear Regression

- Extending the analysis to multiple linear regression.
- Selecting features ('age' and 'bmi') for input and 'charges' as the output.
- Fitting a multiple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
- Performing analysis using Statsmodels' Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.
- Visualizing predictions and model surface in a 3D space.

### Data Visualization

- Visualizing relationships using Seaborn's `pairplot`.
- Creating scatter plots to compare true and predicted values for different sets.

## Note

This code provides introductory examples of data analysis and linear regression. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adapt and extend the code to match your dataset and objectives.
